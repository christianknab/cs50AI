I had a few problems with installing tensorflow on my computer. After some research, I figured out I have to change the requirements.txt to tensorflow-macos to work with my computer and the current version of python I have.
My second issue revolved around loading the data into a numpy ndarray. After reading the documentation for cv2, os.listdir, and os.join, I wrote the code which added every image correctly into an array. However, I was getting an error when converting the image. I realized that on the mac, there is an invisible folder DS_Store. I couldn't figure out a way in my code to ignore this folder. Using the terminal, I found a way to view invisible folders and remove that folder.
My third problem surrounded my convolutional neural network. When I first wrote training code, my accuracy was only 5%. Then, I remembered I should repeat convolution and pooling so the neural network could understand whole objects, rather than basic curves and boundaries.
